      <description>The Plan Up to this point, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used Docker very much. The organizations I worked at were traditional Windows environments with no in-house development. I could see the value in containers generally, but it was hard to justify and especially to convince others it was worth using in those environments.
I&amp;rsquo;ve long hosted various services for myself at home. In the past these were ran on separate Windows VMs so that I could better learn the skills needed for the work I was doing.</description>
