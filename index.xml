      <description>Introduction A while back I built a basic CRUD app to learn more about app development. For a while I hosted it on an EC2 instance, but shut it down at some point. To get it back up an running I decided to split the front end hosting off and use S3.
I had setup a simple website on S3 using the graphical interface before, so this time I wanted to challenge myself by using the command line with AWS CLI.</description>

      <description>Introduction Up to this point, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used Docker very much. The organizations I worked at were traditional Windows environments with no in-house development. I could see the value in containers generally, but it was hard to justify and especially to convince others it was worth using in those environments.
I&amp;rsquo;ve long hosted various services for myself at home. In the past these were ran on separate Windows VMs so that I could better learn the skills needed for the work I was doing.</description>
